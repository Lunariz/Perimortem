The Goal
Perimortem was created during a 48 hour gamejam organised by DGDARC at the University of Utrecht.
The theme of the gamejam was 'Time is running our before you know it'
In a competition against 7 other teams, Perimortem came on top and was declared the winner of the gamejam!

The Team
Our team consisted of:
Lukas Donkers			Programmer
Alexander Leestemaker		Programmer
Arthur Brussee			Programmer
Kevin Hutchinson		Programmer
Marie Lhuissier			Artist
Don Chorus			Sound Design

The Implementation
We utilized the theme of the gamejam by putting emphasis on 'before you know it'. We created a game mechanic revolving around an invisible timer.
Players have to find a 'safe zone' before the end of the timer, and traverse a world through platforming while the clock is ticking.
This creates an interesting mechanic, where the player may choose to skip safe zones because they believe they have plenty of time, and are confident they will find another safe zone in time.
Because invisible mechanics are often frustrating, we strived to give the player many hints about how much time he has left.
The most important hint is the music, which gets more tense as the timer starts to run out - this intensification is done by overlapping tracks created for this purpose.
Levels are generated through procedural level generation, which always creates a feasible path.
Perimortem was created in Unity3D, and Git was used to manage version control.

The Outcome
We are very proud of the result of this gamejam, especially because we won. Of course, there are always improvements to be made.
We may continue work on Perimortem in the future, but do not intend to create anything commercial from it.
Continued work would most likely include:
- Progression (including difficulty and a score system)
- Incentive to skip safe zones and take risks (such as score multipliers)
- Improvement of character control (better animations, more responsive control)
- Improvement of level generation (better chunks, better procedural algorithm)
